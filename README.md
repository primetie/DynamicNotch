  DynamicNotch is a native macOS app for notched MacBooks that turns the notch into a live system surface for media,
  downloads, AirDrop, timers, screen recording, connectivity events, lock-screen transitions, and custom hardware HUDs.

## ✨ Why DynamicNotch

DynamicNotch treats the MacBook notch like a compact native surface instead of a static cutout.
It stays close to the hardware shape until something important happens, then expands with queue-driven
presentation, gesture support, and system-aware feature routing.

The app is built with SwiftUI and AppKit, so the notch window, settings UI, and event handling feel
like part of macOS rather than a web-style overlay.

The difference between this project and others is that it is built on its own engine, and not taken from other ready-made repositories. It completely copies the logic, animations, and behavior of a real Dynamic Island on an iPhone, unlike other projects. 

The main goal is to make the project as native as possible, both in terms of design and interaction.

## 🚀 Highlights

- 🎵 **Live Activities**: Now Playing (media control, album artwork, audio visualizer), Downloads progress, AirDrop, Timer, Screen Recording indicator, Focus mode, Personal Hotspot, and Lock Screen media/live activity surfaces.
- 🏝️ **Dynamic Island (Floating Capsule)**: Automatic support for devices without a physical hardware notch (e.g. non-notched MacBooks, iMac, Mac mini, or external monitors). Transitions to a floating capsule shape (`DynamicIslandShape`) when `topInset == 0`, utilizing dynamic, smooth corner radius transitions.
- ⚡ **Temporary Alerts**: Interactive HUD status for battery charging, low/full battery, Bluetooth connections, Wi-Fi, VPN, Focus-off toggling, and notch size modification settings feedback.
- 🎚️ **Native HUD Replacements**: Beautiful, hardware-inspired HUD overlays for System Volume, Screen Brightness, and Keyboard Backlight.
- 📜 **Chained Lyrics Provider**: A dual-provider API engine (`CompositeLyricsProvider`) combining synchronized LRCLIB karaoke lyrics and static Lyrics.ovh database query fallback.
- 🖱️ **Gestures & Swipe Controls**: Native interactive gestures including mouse drag, trackpad swipes, vertical swipe-to-dismiss/restore, and horizontal trackpad/mouse scroll-to-dismiss.
- 🎨 **Deep Customization**: Personalization options for base notch width/height, stroke options, background styling, animation presets, custom screen/display selection, and fullscreen spaces handling.
- ⚙️ **Refined Animations**: Multi-preset transitions system with separate, dedicated transition tuning parameter `closeLiveActivityCompactContentTransition` to control the exact speed of content insertion when returning to compact mode.

## 📦 Installation

1. Download the latest DMG from the [Releases](https://github.com/jackson-storm/DynamicNotch/releases) page.
2. Drag `DynamicNotch` into `Applications`.
3. Launch the app.
4. Grant the permissions needed for the features you want to use.
5. If macOS blocks the first launch, allow it from `System Settings > Privacy & Security`.

## ✅ Requirements

- macOS 14.6 or later
- Works on both notched MacBooks and non-notched displays (automatically rendering as a floating Dynamic Island capsule)
- Feature-specific permissions as needed:
  - Accessibility for custom HUD interception and some system-level interactions
  - Bluetooth access for accessory status updates
  - Screen Recording access for audio-reactive Now Playing visualization where macOS requires it
  - Media/Now Playing access where macOS requires it

## 🛠️ Build From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackson-storm/DynamicNotch.git
cd DynamicNotch
open DynamicNotch.xcodeproj
```

Then run the `DynamicNotch` scheme from Xcode. Swift Package Manager dependencies are resolved by the project.

## 🏗️ Architecture at a Glance

- `AppContainer` composes services, monitors, feature view models, coordinators, and window managers.
- `AppDelegate` manages app lifecycle, floating overlay window setup, workspace observers, and lock-screen handoff.
- `NotchEngine` owns the queue-driven notch presentation state machine for live activities, temporary alerts, transitions, and restore flows.
- `NotchViewModel` is the SwiftUI-facing layer for geometry, gestures, interactive resize, and engine-backed presentation state.
- `NotchEventCoordinator` routes system events while feature-specific handlers translate them into notch content.
- `SettingsViewModel` acts as a facade over dedicated settings stores for application, media/files, connectivity, battery, HUD, and lock-screen behavior.
- Feature view models provide domain state for battery, Bluetooth, downloads, network, now playing, screen recording, timer, AirDrop, and lock screen.
- Fullscreen hiding keeps the overlay window alive and hides notch activities until the user leaves fullscreen, so active features can restore cleanly.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- SwiftUI for notch content and settings UI
- AppKit for windows, input handling, and macOS integration
- Combine for feature and settings streams
- [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios) for animation assets

## 🌍 Localization

The project currently includes localized app content for:

- System language fallback
- English
- Russian
- Spanish
- Simplified Chinese
